        Description
      </h1>
      <p>
        I have a friend who has a very adorable dog named Thor(pronounced
        Ddoreu). When I talk to my friend, she often says, "Oh, I'm walking
        Thor", "I have to feed him" and more. I got this impression that my
        friend's time is scheduled to Thor. So I decided to make a clock just
        for her, that is Thor himself.

        Design Process

      <p>
        I first go a picture of Thor from my friend(thankfully she allowed be to
        post it here as well), and drew sketches. From my memory, she talked
        about walking, feeding, and playing with Thor. But I added sleeping too,
        because she often kept silent when Thor was asleep.

      <p>
        I thought the second sketch was nice, so I started off with that design.
        But as I coded the things in, I realized that I won't have time to draw
        everything I wanted, so I switched the design a bit. But of course, the
        changed design was also very challenging for me due to the following
        reasons,
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>1. Font needs to be added</li>
        <li>2. Find a way to duplicate things</li>
        <li>3. Make the objects to appear in order</li>
        <li>4. Merge the images</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        For problem 1, I found out that we could upload font files to p5js, so
        it was easily solved. Problem 2 was kind of difficult, but I found about
        about the for property and used it to duplicate the stars. Now, for the
        objects to appear in order, I used if, else, if-else. I divided the
        minute into 4, making every objects to show up for 15 seconds. I
        struggled with ranging the time though, instead of using 15&#60;=s &&
        s&#60;30, I used 15&#60;=s&#60;30 and wondered why the code wasn't
        working for hours.
        <br />
        <br />
        The real problem was problem 4. I searched on Google to find solutions(I
        couldn't ask for help to others because it was too late), but it seemed
        like no one knew the solution to that. So, I decided to fake merge the
        shapes. I had two identical set of code. One on the bottom I added only
        strokes, and the other I added only fill. This method allowed be to make
        the shapes as if they were a single shape.
        <br />
        <br />
        After that, I just added motion to small elements so that people can
        notice the sketch is actually functioning when the object is shown for
        15 seconds.

      <p>
        This was tougher than I thought it would be. The ears and even the
        sparkle was difficult to code. But through this project, I was able to
        really understand how to decode the example codes I found and made it
        into something I could use without searching for it next time. Also, it
        was nice to see my friend get so happy about the project I did :)
