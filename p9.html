      <p>
        Thinking about consent and the camera filter I made for last assignment,
        I tried to better inform people about what it would be like to use the
        camera.
      </p>

      <div class="fullwidth">
        <img
          src="https://cdn.glitch.me/4c7d511d-0346-455e-a5f5-b4ad44b0cb63%2FScreen%20Shot%202021-11-30%20at%206.16.19%20PM.png?v=1638314200161"
        />
      </div>

      <p>
        Before going into design, I made a flow model of what my current camera
        flow was. It was simple, but I thought it would be more consentful if I
        had a preview of the camera and also another function that allowed the
        user to "hide" themselves when using the camera.
        <br /><br />
        So for the information page, I added a preview image of my camera so
        people could see what they are about to see. I also added instructions
        for the users on how and why they could use the slider.
        <br /><br />
        After they enter the camera, the user will still be able to use the
        camera without their figure showing up on the screen. However, it's just
        hiding the image, not stopping the camera from recording them. So I
        added a line in the info stage that it is still being recorded.
      </p>

      <p>
        From the flow modeling, I realized how unconsentful my camera was. I
        tried to make my camera filter more consentful by adding interfaces, but
        I think I could go further, like actually stopping the camera from
        recording when the slider hits 255 or start the camera after the user
        reads the information. This assignment was interesting for me, because
        when I normally finish one project, I don't really think about how this
        can be improved. FRIES was something new to me, so it was even more
        interesting to consider this in this stage. I think from now on, I will
        be more aware of these points when I work on other projects.
      </p>
