        There are many different camera filters on the internet, so I thought a
        lot about what kind of filter I should make. As usual, I start off by
        sketching how my camera filter might look like. I honestly don't enjoy
        taking pictures of myself, so I tried to make a camera that wouldn't
        show the exact figure but still entertaining to use.

        Among the three sketches, I thought the snowflake one looked interesting
        and fun to play with. (Also, I made a Halloween theme assignment, so I
        HAD to make one that relates to Christmas!) However, I had to slightly
        change my original idea. My plan was to make the snowflakes fall and
        make them bigger when they hit certain points. But I couldn't get the
        code work, so I fixed the positions of the snowflakes. In order to make
        it look like as if it were snowing, I added a city as a frame at the
        bottom.

        Through this project, I learned that thinking of a camera filter is not
        as difficult as I thought it would be. However, developing the thought
        and making it into an actual filter was a different story. I had to
        consider how big the snowflakes were and where the frame was going to
        be. The size was important because I did not want to show the exact
        figure, but it still needed to function as a camera filter. Also, I
        needed the frame so that I could show the concept of it.
