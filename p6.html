      <p>
        I am that kind of a person who NEVER leaves the phone alone. I always
        have my phone with me, any time and any where. I suppose it’s sort of a
        bad habit. I decided to track how I talk to other people. Is it through
        the phone? Social media? How many people do I talk with in person? Also,
        I decided to count the number of scam calls I get since I started to get
        A LOT of scam calls and messages after I came here.
        <br /><br />
        Starting from the top right, the sections represent the dates, which is
        Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Press on the buttons
        below to see the data!

        Design Process
      </h1>

      <p>
        I first started off with collecting my data. I honestly didn’t think
        about the design first. So I separated the categories to 4, which were
        online(meaning social media and chat), in person, phone calls and scam
        calls. Other data turned out as I thought, but it was interesting to see
        that I didn’t receive any scam calls or messages on the weekend.
      </p>

      <div class="fullwidth">
        <img
          src="https://cdn.glitch.me/4c7d511d-0346-455e-a5f5-b4ad44b0cb63%2FScreen%20Shot%202021-10-14%20at%2010.19.23%20PM.png?v=1634264695951"
        />
      </div>

      <p>
        I then thought of the design, and I came up with a round graph, showing
        different data sets when I push a button. I thought about animating
        them, too. In the middle, I was planning to add icons to show which data
        the user is looking at.
      </p>

      <div class="fullwidth">
        <img
          style="width:300px;height:300px;"
          src="https://cdn.glitch.me/4c7d511d-0346-455e-a5f5-b4ad44b0cb63%2FFBtRhnLXsAEU7k9.jpeg?v=1634265719749"
        />
        <img
          style="width:300px;height:300px;"
          src="https://cdn.glitch.me/4c7d511d-0346-455e-a5f5-b4ad44b0cb63%2FFBtReaAXMA0l2Qf.jpeg?v=1634265716211"
        />
      </div>

      <p>
        Using the array to insert data was not complicated. However, making the
        buttons work was not as easy as I thought. It may be because I didn’t
        know which keywords to search for, but I was stuck with making the
        buttons for a long time. I wish I have snapshots of all the attempts I
        had. I tried using createButton, mouseClick, and more, but for some
        reason they did not work. So I ended up using if to set up the range and
        to use mouseIsPressed so the ellipse could act as a button. I couldn’t
        animate my graph as I wished it to and the design is slightly off, but I
        was VERY happy that I figured out a way to make the buttons work.

        Reflection

      <p>
        From this project, I learned that I started to communicate with more
        people online. It’s probably because now I’m in New York and most of my
        friends are in Korea or at other parts of America. Since I spent way too
        much time figuring out how to make buttons through p5js, I wasn’t able
        to add certain factors that would allow the users to easily read the
        data, like the week and numbers. Also, I think there might be a more
        efficient way to visualize this data, which looks more like a bar chart.
