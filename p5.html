        This is the traditional pattern of South Korea. It's called
        Dancheong(단청). It is the traditional decorative coloring on wooden
        buildings for style and to protect wood.

        When I first think of Korea's traditional pattern, Dancheong comes to my
        mind, especially those painted under the roof. I think it's fascinating
        that only when the visitors get near the architecture and pay close
        attention to the roof get to see the beautiful patterns.

        I thought it would be nice to use the flower pattern and the rings along
        the sides of the pillar. I simplified the patterns, but used the rings
        to make some kind of an optical illusion. To match the mouse
        interaction, which is applied to the multiple rings, I rotated the
        flower patterns too.
        <br /><br />
        I used a lot of for loop in order to make the flower patterns. But I
        think I used that function too much. The p5js website started crashing.
        So I kind of solved it by dividing the function. I also had another
        problem though, I got confused how I could use the for loop for function
        mainPattern since I wasn't quite sure where I could add the parameters.
        In the end, I simply duplicated the mainPattern, but I will find the
        answer and fix the code.

      <p>
        I used too much of the for loop, and I think that caused the website of
        crash whenever I tried to fix the for loop. I should think of ways to
        code in a simple way, so no one will have any trouble trying out my
        design or even decode my code.
