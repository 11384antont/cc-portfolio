        Description
      </h1>
      <p>
        My friends describe me as a very active and bright person, but they also
        say I look very calm when I'm not with other people. In this face
        generator project, I tried to show these two expressions using
        random/mousePress/mouseX & Y.

        Design Process
      </h1>

      <p>
        I drew a simple sketch on the grid template before I started coding. I
        wanted to express the emotions by not only through the face emotions,
        but also with colors and the shape of the face.
      </p>

      <div class="fullwidth">
        <img
          src="https://cdn.glitch.com/4c7d511d-0346-455e-a5f5-b4ad44b0cb63%2FKakaoTalk_Image_2021-09-14-13-32-57.jpeg?v=1631640787760"
        />
      </div>

      <p>
        After I did the sketching, I searched for ways to code the interactions
        I was thinking for, changing the shape of the face as the mouse moves
        and changing the eyes when the face is clicked. For the face morph, I
        used mouseX and mouseY data to stretch multiple ellipses. Then, I gave
        the individual ellipses an angle so if I added noStroke to the drawing,
        it would look like as if the face shape was changing. For the face
        emotions, I used mousePressed and if/else so the sketch would show two
        face emotions.

      <p>
        It was an interesting experiment to do. I tackled down the code for the
        example project by Nicky Du and learned a lot from doing so. I do want
        to make the shape of the flower other than using multiple ellipses, but
        I coulded do so because it was difficult to draw that particular shape
        on p5.js, and I wasn't able to do the morphing. I hope that I will be
        able to morph some shapes afterwards, so the shape will also look like a
        flower when the mouse is placed on the (200~400) area.
