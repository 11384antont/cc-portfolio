        Description
      </h1>
      <p>
        I love traveling, and food is always the first thing I consider when
        planning for one. Through this game, I wanted to introduce some places I
        really enjoyed!

        Design Process

      <h2>
        Proposal
      </h2>

      <p>
        Will be updated (Character, Storyboard) When I got this assignment, I
        wanted to create a fun, playful game. So I decided to go with the topic
        that makes me happy, which is travel. But travel itself was to vague, so
        I narrowed it down to the food that I ate during my trips. I first
        listed the countries that I went to with the food I remember liking, and
        chose Japan and Thailand as the mini game theme. I then drew a very
        rough sketch of my game scenes. My game basically needed the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Intro: Choose Game</li>
        <li>Mini Game x2: Japan and Thailand</li>
        <li>Success Page: Try another game</li>
        <li>Fail Page: Retry or try another game</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="fullwidth">
        <img
          src="https://cdn.glitch.me/4c7d511d-0346-455e-a5f5-b4ad44b0cb63%2FMask%20Group%402x.png?v=1637185031426"
        />
      </div>

      <h2>
        Gray Boxing
      </h2>
      <p>
        This took the most time doing. For the game, I needed keep track of how
        many times the user won a game, allow them to restart the game, and
        refresh the game so all the counts(time, points etc) went back to the
        original values. The most difficult part for me during this part was the
        reseting. When I playtested the gray box, I was not able to finish the
        game as I planned it because the values did not reset. So I made it
        reset by adding the reset code to every scene jump at the end of the
        game.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Designing
      </h2>
      <p>
        After I did the gray boxing, I sketched the character that the user
        would be moving. Then I designed how the scenes would look like. As I
        designed the scenes, I realized I needed the instructions for the games
        since each game uses different keys, Japan game uses the arrow key and
        Thailand game uses mouse click.

        Reflection
      </h1>

      <p>
        Since I had to think about coding, design, and the entire story of the
        game, it was a tough assignment compared to the previous ones. However,
        I think this project made me think about UX, which was not the thing
        that I considered with the past works. I considered how the users would
        react to the scene switches and checked they did not get lost between
        them. It was my first time making a game, so I think there may be some
        places where I can make the UX better. From now on, I will try to think
        of how I can make the UX better with the assignments.
