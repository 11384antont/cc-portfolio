        "The object I lost was a sweatshirt. It was navy blue, and had a
        sailboat in the middle of it. It was a sweatshirt I had for years and
        was from a small shop in Vermont, at the lake I have gone to with my
        family for years. The sailboat was white and about the size of a fist,
        at the middle upper half of the sweatshirt. I haven’t been able to find
        anything like it since. I lost it a couple years ago when I was visiting
        someone."

      <p>
        I first drew a sketch based on the description Nell gave me. Then, I
        drew over the the sketch with 2D primitives. Following shapes were
        needed:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>7 rectangles</li>
        <li>6 triangles</li>
        <li>1 quardrilateral</li>
        <li>1 ellipse</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="fullwidth">
        <img
          src="https://cdn.glitch.com/4c7d511d-0346-455e-a5f5-b4ad44b0cb63%2FKakaoTalk_Image_2021-09-06-14-40-47.jpeg?v=1630953657508"
        />
      </div>

      <p>
        I started off by sketching the sweatshirt. I worked on the body first,
        then the arms. After I made the basic sweatshirt, I coded the sailboat.
        Since the sailboat had details in it, I sketched the sailboat before
        moving the figure to its position, middle upper part of the shirt. After
        I finished sketching the basic image of the sweatshirt, I deleted the
        basic strokes and added the colors according to the description given.

      <p>
        The way Nell described her lost item was clear, so it was easy for me to
        visualize it. Since I’m new to coding, I used plenty of time to draw the
        sketch of the item in detail. I think this process helped me code the
        lost item faster.
      </p>
      <p>
        After finishing this assignment, I realized that there is something
        similar with drawing and coding in p5.js. Both materials visually
        depicted the image I wanted to make, which helped me a lot since I was
        able to see the changes visually and immediately. But, I did struggle
        with positioning the 2D primitives to the places I wanted.
