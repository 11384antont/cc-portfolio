        We first met through Discord and shared our sketches and brief
        background stories related to the sketches. Then we each got other
        people's sketches' body parts.
      </p>

        What I found interesting in Sahiti's drawing was that the hand was cut
        off. Looking at the hand, I decided to use it in my design. I planned to
        simply sketch out the body, but use the hand as a mouse cursor that
        changes at different parts of the screen. I designed different cursors
        -- a hand with skin, a hand with bones, and a star (I didn't know what
        kind of hand I should design for a squid, so I went with the magical
        theme).
      </p>

      <p>
        I first coded out the head part. I used multiple ellipses for the hair
        because I thought it was the easier way to give hair motions as if there
        was wind blowing. <br /><br />Then, I sketched the upper body, which is
        the skeleton. Since most of the elements were repeated, I used "for" so
        I won't have to type in the same code over and over again. I thought
        about adding the arm part to the skeleton, but I decided to take it out
        because I thought the mouse cursor was the highlgiht for my project.
        <br /><br />
        Then for the lower body. I initially thought of using curveVertex and
        strokeWeight to make the tentacles move, but I found out that it was
        nearly impossible for me to understand the sample codes I found. I saved
        a copy of the code for the future me to understand, and used plain
        ellipses to make the tentacles, just like the hair.
        <br /><br />
        Then I used if-else for the mouse cursor. I divided the screen into
        three equal sections so the themes would match. After making the cursor,
        I added backgrounds to enhance the theme of the project.

        It was interesting to learn about personalizing functions. Last week I
        did use it for decoration, but didn't fully understand why the code was
        in a different function. Also, it was a great fun to share drawings with
        the group and try using the sketches to design a project. I honestly
        still don't understand sin and cos (I learned it in High School but now
        I forgot about it). My next goal is to now understand how sin and cos is
        used.
